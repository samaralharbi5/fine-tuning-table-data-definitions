    "\n",
    "A number of columns were probably created as CHAR or TEXT fields, but have only a small number of distinct values.  Those would be more efficiently and descriptively stored as enumerations.  You can create one within a particular database using code similar to (example from MySQL documentation):\n",

    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an enumeration would be useful, for example, for `airline_sentiment`:\n",

    "The this task you need to complete two parts.  First you should create tables `timezones` and `airlines`, and populate them with the values currently existing for the foreign key column.  In each case, simply add a second text column called `description` (although more specific fields would clearly be needed for a production use).\n",
